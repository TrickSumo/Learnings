The locals block in Terraform allows to define local values within your configuration.

Local values are intermediate or derived values that are calculated or constructed based on other variables, expressions, or resources in your Terraform configuration. 

The purpose of the locals block is to provide a way to store and reuse these derived values within the configuration.
